# Dave's Dotfiles

About time I got around to organizing this stuff in some sort of coherent repo.
Hint for anyone interested: don't just clone the repo and run `install.sh`;
everything in here is how *I* like it, not necessarily how *you* want it. Go
through it, try bits, pick and choose. There's no real overall design, this is
just stuff I've cobbled together over the years: there's probably
inconsistencies, redundancies, and even insanities.

Bear in mind I run a pretty vanilla Ubuntu setup, so if you're on something
else like Kubuntu, Arch, Gentoo, Mac OS X, whatever you'll definitely need to
tweak stuff (yet another reason not to go cloning wholesale!).
